The shared dependencies between the files "package.json", "package-lock.json", and "node_modules/" when updating to install with npm create svelte@latest are:

1. "svelte": This is the main dependency that is shared across all files. It is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. It is specified in the "package.json" file and its detailed version information is stored in "package-lock.json". The actual package resides in the "node_modules/" directory.

2. "rollup": This is a module bundler for JavaScript which compiles small pieces of code into something larger and more complex, such as a library or application. It is also specified in the "package.json" file, with detailed version information in "package-lock.json", and the actual package in "node_modules/".

3. "npm": This is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. It is used to install, share, and distribute code, and manage dependencies in projects. It is implicitly shared as it manages the "package.json" and "package-lock.json" files and the "node_modules/" directory.

4. "start", "build", "dev", "cy:open", "cy:run": These are scripts specified in the "package.json" file. They are shared as they define the commands to start the application, build the application, run in development mode, open Cypress, and run Cypress respectively.

5. "dependencies" and "devDependencies": These are sections in the "package.json" file that list the packages your project depends on. "dependencies" are required to run, while "devDependencies" are only needed for development.

6. "version": This is a field in the "package.json" file that specifies the current version of the application. It is also reflected in the "package-lock.json" file.

7. "name": This is a field in the "package.json" file that specifies the name of the application. It is also reflected in the "package-lock.json" file.

Note: The actual names of exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific Svelte application being created.
